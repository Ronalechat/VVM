#Vegan Vending Machine - Ordermentum Code Test

The vending machine interface is run through the index.html file. Open in a browser to deposit fake coins, and vend some fake vegan snacks!

To run tests, go to jasmine-standalone-3.1.0>SpecRunner.html. The VendingMachineSpec.js file contains the jasmine tests for allowing currencies, and successful purchases.
